            What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A unit test is a way to test a unit, the smallest code in a system
            that can logically be isolated. Unit testing ensures that all code
            meets quality standards before it's deployed. This ensures a
            reliable engineering environment where quality is paramount. Over
            the course of the product development life cycle, unit testing saves
            time and money, and helps developers write better code, more
            efficiently.
